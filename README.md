Here I will be practicing lessons about flexbox.

* In the FLEXBOX file I did test the justify-content property.

* In FLEXBOX-2 file I did the same with positioning items. I did use the margin property and justify-content from the previous lesson.

* In FLEXBOX-3 I have worked with the flex property to resize and to make responsive the items in a flexbox.

* In FLEXBOX-4 I did work with align-items property, this time is about the cross axis unlike the previous lessons where I have worked along the main axis and we also have worked with the flex-direction property.

* In FLEXBOX-5 we did work with the flex-direction property.

* In FLEXBOX-6 we've worked with flexbox order.

* In NAVBAR we built a responsive navigation bar using the properties we've learned in the previous lessons.

* In FLEX-IMAGE-GRID I've built an image grid using the flexbox properties.
