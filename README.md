Here I will be practicing with flexbox.

* In the FLEXBOX file I did test the justify-content property.

* In FLEXBOX-2 file I did the same with positioning items. I did use the margin property and justify-content from the previous lesson.

* In FLEXBOX-3 I have worked with the flex property to resize and to make responsive the items in a flexbox.

* In FLEXBOX-4 I did work with align-items property, this time is about the cross axis unlike the previous lessons where I have worked along the main axis and we also have worked with the flex-direction property.

* In FLEXBOX-5 we did worked with the flex-direction property.
